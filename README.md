1. `Plot_session.m`: main scripts for running the analysis and plotting. All plotting functions are in the folder `+plt_session`. `average_RRR` is the function that averages activitiy within a region and run RRR. To remove signal correlation, pass `Xsup`, `Xdeep` after subtracting condition-averaged activity.

2. `Poster.m`: scripts to make the poster figures. There might be some intermedieate results missing to run through the whole script. 

3. `main_ACC.m`, `axis_angle.m`: some codes that I write to explore analysis. Less organized but I put them in there just in case.
